# NumPy Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project is a **menu-driven Python program** that performs different **NumPy data analytics operations**.
It allows users to create arrays and perform analysis such as indexing, slicing, mathematical operations, sorting, filtering, and statistical calculations.

The program is designed for **beginners** to understand NumPy concepts easily.

## Features

* Create **1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy arrays**
* Indexing and slicing operations
* Mathematical operations:

  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
* Combine and split arrays
* Search, sort, and filter values
* Aggregate and statistical functions:

  * Sum
  * Mean
  * Median
  * Standard Deviation
  * Variance
* Simple menu-driven interface

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy Library
